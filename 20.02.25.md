?: unproper config of windows manager Xmonad leads to black screen, unable to enter log in page

Reason: the broken Xmonad was set as the default display manager

1. enter ```ubuntu recovery mode```
2. check other possibilities, then reboot as normal
3. ```control shift 1```enter tty1 terminal
4. find out that ```i3```working normally, also check ```journalctl -xe```
5. ```gnome-session``` manually could enter into a new but different desktop mode, but the usual username cannot log in
6. findout that ```gdm``` is inactive, nothing about ```Lightdm, Xdm```
7. ```systemctl status/restart gdm```
8. log into the normal ubuntu desktop successfully, reboot also successful.
9. check the history of .xsession-error, remove everything about the broken Xmonad.
